    "Fire department response times are a critical metric for the efficiency of emergency services, especially in large urban environments like New York City. The time it takes for fire departments to respond to an incident can significantly impact the severity of damage and the number of lives saved. Understanding the factors that influence these response times can help improve operational efficiency and allocate resources more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project leverages the Fire Incident Dispatch Data from NYC Open Data, which contains detailed information about over 11 million fire incidents in New York City. The data includes timestamps for when incidents are created and closed, the type of incidents, the resources assigned, and the response times of the fire department. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to predict whether a fire incident's response time is valid (i.e., within an acceptable time frame). This prediction will help inform decisions on resource allocation and response optimization, ultimately improving the fire department's efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use machine learning classification techniques to predict whether the response time is valid, based on various features such as the location of the incident, the type of emergency, and the resources assigned. The datasetâ€™s large size and variety of features make it a valuable resource for understanding patterns in response times across New York City."

    "The Fire Incident Dispatch Data from NYC Open Data tracks fire incidents across New York City, providing over 11.1 million rows of data across 29 columns. This dataset includes information about when and where an incident occurs, the type of emergency, and how long it took for the fire department to respond. For this analysis, we focused on the following relevant features, which directly affect the fire department's response time and the validity of that response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INCIDENT_BOROUGH:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: Indicates the borough where the fire incident occurred (e.g., Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevance: The borough where an incident takes place can significantly affect the response time, as factors such as traffic, proximity to fire stations, and the density of buildings influence how quickly emergency services can respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cleaning: This column was retained after removing redundant columns like ALARM_BOX_BOROUGH, which contained the same information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. CALL_TYPE:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: The type of emergency call (e.g., fire, medical emergency, medical first aid).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevance: The type of emergency determines the resources required and can influence how quickly those resources are dispatched. For example, medical emergencies may have a different urgency compared to fire-related incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cleaning: This categorical feature was retained to understand how different types of calls impact response times.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. RESPONSE_TIME:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: The time taken by the fire department to respond to the incident (in seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevance: This is the target variable for our analysis. The goal is to predict whether this response time is valid (i.e., within the required time frame) based on the features in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cleaning: This numerical feature was retained for modeling purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. VALID_INCIDENT_RSPNS_TIME_INDC:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: A binary feature indicating whether the incident's response time was valid (1 for valid, 0 for invalid).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevance: This is the target variable for our classification model. We aim to predict whether the response time meets the required standards for a valid response.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cleaning: This feature was mapped from categorical ('Y', 'N') values to binary (1, 0) values for classification purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. RESOURCE_ASSIGNMENT:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: Describes the number and type of resources assigned to the incident (e.g., engines, trucks, ambulances).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevance: The quantity and type of resources dispatched to an incident can directly affect the response time. More resources may lead to a faster and more efficient response.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cleaning: These features were retained as numerical variables for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "6. ALARM_SOURCE_DESCRIPTION_TX:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: Indicates the source of the fire alarm (e.g., phone call, private fire alarm).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevance: The source of the alarm can influence how quickly the fire department is alerted and how rapidly they can respond. Some sources may provide more accurate or urgent information, leading to quicker responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cleaning: This categorical feature was encoded numerically for use in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. INCIDENT_CLASSIFICATION_GROUP:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: Categorizes the type of incident (e.g., medical emergencies, non-medical emergencies, structural fires).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevance: Different types of incidents may require different types of responses. This feature helps to segment the data by incident type and understand how these types affect response times.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cleaning: This feature was retained and encoded numerically for use in the classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. ENGINES_ASSIGNED_QUANTITY:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: The number of fire engines assigned to the incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevance: The number of engines dispatched can significantly influence the time it takes for the fire department to respond, especially for larger fires or incidents requiring more equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cleaning: This numerical feature was retained for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. LADDERS_ASSIGNED_QUANTITY:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: The number of ladder trucks assigned to the incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevance: Ladder trucks are used for accessing high-rise buildings or performing rescues. Their assignment can influence the efficiency of the response and the speed at which operations are carried out.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cleaning: This feature was retained as part of the resource assignment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. OTHER_UNITS_ASSIGNED_QUANTITY:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Description: The number of other units (e.g., ambulances, rescue units) assigned to the incident.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevance: The number of additional units assigned to an incident could affect the speed of response, especially if the incident involves multiple types of emergencies or requires a large number of responders.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cleaning: This feature was retained as part of the resource assignment data."
